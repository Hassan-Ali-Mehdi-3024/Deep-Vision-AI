# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Problem
Vercel build was failing with:
```
sh: line 1: /vercel/path0/node_modules/.bin/vite: Permission denied
Error: Command "npm run build" exited with 126
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created `vercel.json` Configuration
This file tells Vercel exactly how to build and deploy your Vite application:
- Framework: Vite
- Output directory: dist
- Proper routing for SPA (Single Page Application)

### 2. Updated `package.json`
- Added TypeScript compilation step: `tsc && vite build`
- Added lint script for type checking

### 3. Created `.vercelignore`
Excludes unnecessary files from deployment to reduce build size and time.

### 4. Updated `.gitignore`
Added Vercel-specific files and folders.

### 5. Updated README.md
Added comprehensive deployment instructions for Vercel and other platforms.

## Next Steps to Deploy

### Option 1: Re-deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. The new configuration will be picked up automatically

### Option 2: Deploy via Git Push
1. Commit the new configuration files:
```bash
git add vercel.json .vercelignore .gitignore package.json README.md
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment configuration"
git push
```
2. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment

### Option 3: Deploy via Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

## Files Created/Updated

✅ `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration (NEW)
✅ `.vercelignore` - Files to exclude from deployment (NEW)
✅ `package.json` - Updated build script
✅ `.gitignore` - Added Vercel folders
✅ `README.md` - Added deployment section

## Expected Outcome

After redeploying with these changes, your build should:
1. ✅ Install dependencies successfully
2. ✅ Run TypeScript compilation
3. ✅ Build with Vite
4. ✅ Deploy to Vercel
5. ✅ Work with proper SPA routing

## Troubleshooting

If the issue persists:

1. **Check Node.js version in Vercel:**
   - Go to Project Settings > General
   - Set Node.js Version to "18.x" or "20.x"

2. **Clear Vercel cache:**
   - Redeploy with "Clear cache and redeploy" option

3. **Verify build locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   If it works locally, it should work on Vercel.

## Support

If you still encounter issues, check:
- Vercel build logs for specific errors
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Verify `vite.config.ts` is correct
